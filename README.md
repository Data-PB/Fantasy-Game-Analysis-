### Heroes of Pymoli

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, I was asked to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

#### Observable Trends

•	Majority of players are male (84%) out of total 573 players.
•	Most of the player are below 24years of age with following age bracket representation 20-24 years (45%), followed by 15-19(18.58%) and 25-29(13.37%).
•	Age group 20-24 spends the most money, total purchase value of $1,114.06 and average purchase of $4.32 per person. However, age group 35-39 has the highest average purchase of $4.76 per person and total purchase value of $147.67.

### Py City School 

Analyzed the district-wide standardized test results for every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attended.

#### Observable Trends

•	More a school spends per student, the lower the average math and reading scores. In schools with the lowest spend per student, the percent of students passing both math and reading is almost 37% higher than in the schools with the highest spend per student.
•	Reading scores were consistently higher than math scores among both lower- and higher-performing schools. Only smaller and charter schools almost closed this gap.
•	Larger schools on average spent more per student than smaller schools. This could indicate that they have a student population that has higher needs, or it may indicate some are not leveraging their scale to produce efficiencies.
•	Looking at grade averages is not a good predictor of passing rate. Charter schools had an average reading score of 84 but achieved a 96.5% passing rate, while district schools had an average of 81 with only an 81% passing rate. Median score might provide a more useful measure.
•	According to the data, charter schools have an overall passing rate almost 37% higher than that of district schools. This is ironically close to the difference between the schools with the lowest and highest spend per student.
